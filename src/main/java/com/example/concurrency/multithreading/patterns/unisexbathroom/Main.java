 * A bathroom is being designed for the use of both males and females in an office
 * but requires the following constraints to be maintained:
 *
 * There cannot be men and women in the bathroom at the same time.
 * There should never be more than three employees in the bathroom simultaneously.
 * The solution should avoid deadlocks. For now, though, donâ€™t worry about starvation.
